# Hospital Dashboard
 
# Description 
This is a dashboard built in Tableau. The dataset contains several information of patients at Emergency Room.

# Findings
The patient satisfaction score is 5 out of 10 which is below the average score of 7.1.
The average wait time for each division is approximately 35 minutes and is approximately the same across all divisions at the hospital. 
The long wait time could be the possible reason for low satisfaction score. 
About 16 patients come in daily on average and this number is fairly consistent. 
Equal proportion of men and women come into ER.
The age distribution of patients is approximately uniform from 0 to 80. 

# Remark
Since this dataset is fake, there is no interesting insights to draw from the data.
